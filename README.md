This program asks for IP Address input from the user separated by commas and generates a pie chart in the form of a png that displays the corresponding country associated with the IP Address.

We will be using two APIs:

An API that gets the website visitor's IP address and turns it into data (ipStack).
An API that generates a graph based on input (Quickchart).

TO USE THIS CODE
1. Run the code
2. It will ask you for a set of IP Addresses as input. The input MUST be separated by commas.
EX. 134.201.250.155, 72.229.28.185, 110.174.165.78, 103.177.115.255,13.33.152.0, 8.8.8.8, 101.235.255.255
3. It will generate a pie chart in the files section as an image.
4. You can find this graph in content/country_chart.png

BEFORE RUNNING THIS CODE
1. You need to set up 1 API key for ipStack
